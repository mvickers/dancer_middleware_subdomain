Dancer::Middleware::Subdomain

Use this library to enable a SUBDOMAIN element in the request environment. It is handy to partition your 
application based on the subdomain in certain circumstances.

Enable it in your dancer config.yml thusly

plack_middlewares:
  -
    - "+Dancer::Middleware::Subdomain"
    - domain
    - your.domain
    - ignore_subdomains
    -
      - www
      - admin

You need to set the domain parameter and you may set the subdomains to ignore. In the event a 
subdomain has been ignored the SUBDOMAIN element in the request will be empty, not undefined.

In  your route you can then use the following to determine which subdomain has been requested

    my $subdomain = request->env->{ SUBDOMAIN };
    if($subdomain) {
	...
    }
